## Basic Operation

The DN-112 provides 12 independant digital noise sources each producing a pseudo-random sequence of high and low voltages with a long
periodicity. The noise algorithm is based on a 32-bit linear feedback shift register 6.

The register shifts once every sample.

## Signal Range

The voltage range of the digital gates can be configured from the context menu. The device will output at the full range of the configured settings. The inputs will measure a logical high signal anywhere above the midpoint of the configured range.
